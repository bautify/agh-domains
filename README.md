| optional-list.txt | -- | This file contain domains that are needed to be whitelisted depending on the service you use. It may contain some tracking site but sometimes it's necessary to add bad domains to make a few services to work. Currently there is no script for this list, you have to add domains manually to your Pi-Hole.
